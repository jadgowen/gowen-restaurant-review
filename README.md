## Instructions

The goal of the project is to convert a non-responsive review site into a responsive site with serviceWorker functionality and ARIA accessibility standards.

Access to the project in its entirety can be found [here](https://github.com/jadgowen/gowen-restaurant-review).

After cloning the project, serve the project locally to inspect functionality. I used [Python](https://www.python.org/) for testing purposes.

## Comments

This Restaurant Review project leveraged existing css, html, and js resources associated with the project. It was also inspired by all of the great contributors at sites like StackOverflow, MDN Developer, w3 Schools, and most impressive, the great students at Udacity!

A special thank you to the Udacity team for providing peer-submitted resources, and an **extra** thank you to [Matthew Cranford](https://matthewcranford.com/) for his incredibly helpful tutorials and walkthroughs.

## Dependencies

The project references scripts in its css folder and js folder, images from its images folder, and uses [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) for its map functionality.
